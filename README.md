2. [Configuring the network_config module)](#configuring-the-network_config-module)



### Introduction

This module takes a rather complex set of hiera data to manage network infrastructures on Network Manager based systems (eg: RHEL7).  It supports:

* A type and provider to manage network interfaces
* A type and provider to manage IP allocations
* A type and provider to manage statuc IP routes
* Set of Puppet classes to manage network infrastructures from hiera data

This module manages the interface configuration files in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts`, as well as starting and stopping interfaces.

You can choose just to use the [Types and providers](#types-and-providers) that this module exposes, `network_interface` and `ip_allocation` and wrap these into your own module.  Or the [puppet module can be used](#Configuring-the-network_config-module) to define complex network infrastructures in Hiera.


### OS Support

The only officially supported OS for this module right now is RedHat/CentOS 7.0 - support for RHEL6 is limited and not very well tested at this time.

## Types and providers

### `network_interface`

#### Example

```puppet
network_interface { 'ens33':
  ensure    => 'present',
  bootproto => 'static',
  device    => 'ens33',
  ipv6init  => 'yes',
  netboot   => 'yes',
  onboot    => 'yes',
  type      => 'Ethernet',
}
```

#### Description and parameters

This type takes an interface name as a title and configures the interface in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<name>`  See the [configuration parameter reference](#configuration-parameter-reference) for a complete list of configurable parameters that this type accepts.

### `ip_allocation`

#### Example

```puppet
ip_allocation { '192.168.193.3':
  ensure    => 'present',
  gateway   => '192.168.193.100',
  interface => 'ens33',
  prefix    => '24',
}
```

#### Description and parameters

This type takes an IP address as the resource title.  Supported parameters are:

| Parameter       | Description                  |
| ---------       | -----------                  |
| `ensure`        | `present` or `absent`        |
| `interface`     | The interface name this allocation is assigned to |
| `prefix`        | The prefix (CIDR notation) of the IP address |
| `netmask`       | The netmask of the IP address (eg: 255.255.255.0) |
| `gateway`       | The gateway for this IP allocation |

Note that only one of `prefix` or `netmask` should be used.

Multiple IP addresses bound to the same interface will be configured with their numerical identifier (eg: `IPADDR0`, `PREFIX0`, `IPADDR1`, `PREFIX1`, `IPADDR2`, `PREFIX2`...etc).  The provider also ensures that when removing an IP allocation for an interface that all the numerical identifiers are re-sorted if there are gaps in the sequence, since Network Manager will not read beyond the first gap.

IP addresses are considered unique, therefore changing the `interface` parameter will have the effect of moving the IP allocation from one interface to another

```
Network_config::Ifconfig[ens99]/Ip_allocation[10.7.6.10]/interface: interface changed 'ens39' to 'ens99'
```

### `ip_route`

#### Example

```puppet
ip_route { '10.72.1.0/24':
  ensure    => 'present',
  gateway   => '10.72.1.1',
  interface => 'ens33',
}
```

#### Description and parameters

This type takes an CIDR address as the resource title.  Supported parameters are:

| Parameter       | Description                  |
| ---------       | -----------                  |
| `ensure`        | `present` or `absent`        |
| `interface`     | The interface name this route is assigned to |
| `gateway`       | The gateway for the static route |
|

There are two optional parameters which are the resources _namevars_, `netmask` and `address` - if these two attributes are not set then the CIDR range from the resource title is used to populate the netmask and address.


### Purging

Both `network_interface` and `ip_allocation` are purgable resources, meaning they support the `instances()` method.  We recommend using the [crayfishx/purge](https://forge.puppet.com/crayfishx/purge) module as it offers more finite control over purging, for example, to purge all unmanaged IP allocations, except the loopback interface, you could do something like

```puppet
purge { 'ip_allocation':
  unless => [ 'interface', '==', 'lo' ],
}
```

For purging all interfaces and ip_allocations you can also set the `purge_interfaces` and `purge_ip_allocations` options on the `network_config` class.  When using these options, any interfaces with a `name` or `device` matching an entry in `exclude_if`, plus any IP allocations with an `interface` matching an entry in `exclude_if` will *not* be purged.   (NOTE: make sure you are running crayfishx/purge >= 1.1.0).  As a further precaution, an ip_allocation of `127.0.0.1` will never be purged by the class.

```
class { 'network_config': }
```


### Parameters

| Parameter       | Description                  | Default   |

| `restart_interface`* | Whether or not to restart the affected network interface on change | false |

 _* only one of restart_interface or restart_service can be defined_


### Configuration using hiera


#### `network_config::interfaces`

This setting is a list of interfaces that we want to configure on the system.  If it is not set then the module will use the output of the `interfaces` fact.  To override this, we can give a comma separated list of the interfaces that we want to manage.  Eg:

```yaml
network_config::interfaces: eth0,eth1,eth2
```

Note that this is a comma separated _string_, with no spaces.  Not an array.

#### `network_config::interface_names`

The first thing that should be configured are interface names.  We define interface configuration parameters against interface _types_, that is, instead of saying `eth0`, `eth1`...etc, we assign friendly names to these interfaces and refer to them by the type of interface they are, eg: management.  For each interface we want to manage we assign it a type, eg:

```yaml
network_config::interface_names:
  eth0: management
  eth1: application
  eth2: backup
```
*interface_names* is a meaningfull label only used within the context of hiera and puppet.

#### `network_config::defaults`

Now that we have our interface type names defined in `interface_names` we can add some global defaults to each of these interface types.  We have the opportunity to override these in specific circumstances, but things that are generally global such as domain, can be configured as defaults.  Eg:

```yaml
network_config::defaults:
  management:
    bootproto: "none"
    defroute: "no"
    dns1: 10.0.8.2
    dns2: 10.0.8.3
    dns3: 10.0.8.4
    domain: enviatics.com
    onboot: "yes"
  backup:
    bootproto: "none"
    defroute: "no"
    dns1: 10.0.0.2
    dns2: 10.0.0.3
    dns3: 10.0.0.4
    domain: enviatics.com
    interface_type: "Ethernet"
    onboot: "yes"
  application:
    bootproto: "none"
    defroute: "no"
    dns1: 10.0.6.2
    dns2: 10.0.6.3
    dns3: 10.0.6.4
    domain: app.enviatics.com
    onboot: "yes"
```

See the configuration parameter appendix for a list of supported parameters.

#### `network_config::vlans`

This setting gives us specific control to add configuration or override defaults for different vlans. Eg:

```yaml
network_config::vlans:
  100:
    prefix: 24
    gateway: 10.0.8.1
  200:
    prefix: 32
    gateway: 10.0.0.1
  300:
    prefix: 24
    gateway: 10.0.6.3
```

Note that any configuration parameter can be overridden here for a specific vhost, eg:

```yaml
network_config::vlans:
  100:
    prefix: 24
    gateway: 10.0.8.1
    domain: vlan_100.enviatics.com
```

#### `network_config::ifconfig`

The `ifconfig` setting would normally be configured at the host level in your lookup hierarchy, and it's this parameter which ties together and inherits all of the above default settings.  `ifconfig` is a hash of interface types and configuration parameters, it accepts any configuration parameter as a host specific override, as well as `vlan` to inherit configuration parameters from the VLAN is belongs to.  A simple example would be:

```yaml
network_config::ifconfig:
  application:
    ipaddr: 10.0.8.101
    vlan: 100
```

The above configuration will get all the default configuration for a management interface type, the gateway and prefix parameters inherited from the assigned VLAN and we are specifying the IP address specific to this host.

Like the other options, you can override any configuration parameter at this level and it will take priority, eg:

```yaml
network_config::ifconfig:
  application:
    ipaddr: 10.0.8.101
    vlan: 100
    gateway: 10.0.8.254
```

This will override the VLAN default and set the gateway to .254

The `ipaddr` parameter can also take an array

```yaml
network_config::ifconfig:
  application:
    ipaddr:
      - 10.0.8.101
      - 10.0.8.102
    vlan: 100
```

In the above example we will end up with a configuration file that contains

```
IPADDR0=10.0.8.101
GATEWAY0=10.0.8.1
PREFIX0=24

IPADDR1=10.0.8.102
GATEWAY1=10.0.8.1
PREFIX1=24
```

Note that the `PREFIX` and `GATEWAY` in this example were automatically worked out, as they are inherited from the VLAN that the interface has been assigned to.

#### Override priorities

When evaluating the configuration, the module will prioritise duplicate settings top down in the following order (first has highest priority/win)

* `network_config::ifconfig`
* `network_config::vlans` (if supplied to `network_config::ifconfig`)
* `network_config::bonds` (see below)
* `network_config::defaults` for the specific type of interface being configured.


### Bonding

If you need to bond multiple interfaces for a particular interface type you can follow much of the same procedure... firstly we create an additional network interface type for bond interface defaults, the name does not matter.  Eg:

```yaml
network_config::defaults
  ...
  bond_interface:    
    bootproto: "none"
    defroute: "no"
    onboot: "yes"
```

Next we assign two interfaces that we want to be the bound interface slaves.  We also define a new interface that will be our `bond0` and we can give it an interface type like we did earlier, eg:

```yaml
network_config::interface_names:
  ...
  eth3: bond_interface
  eth4: bond_interface
  bond0: application
```

This will configure `bond0` as an application interface inheriting all of our defaults from that type.  We also have `eth3` and `eth4` configured with general bonding defaults.

The final step is to define which real interfaces are slaves of which bond interfaces, we do this with the `bonds` parameter.

```yaml
network_config::bonds:
  bond0:
    interfaces:
      - eth3
      - eth4
```

The above will make sure that `eth3` and `eth4` interfaces are configured as slaves of `bond0` with

```
NAME=ens51
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
```

... as well as all the inherited configuration from the `bond_interface` type.

The `bonds` hash can also contain other bond specific configuration to apply to the bond interface (`bond0` in our example). Eg:

```yaml
network_config::bonds:
  bond0:
    bonding_opts: 'miimon=100 mode=1'
    interfaces:
      - eth3
      - eth4
```

Shared configuration common to all bond interfaces maybe defined in the `bond_defaults` hash

```yaml
network_config::bond_defaults
  bonding_opts: 'miimon=100 mode=1'


network_config::bonds:
  bond0:
    interfaces:
      - eth3
      - eth4
```

both configure in `bond0`

```
BONDING_OPTS=miimon=100 mode=1
```


### Teaming

Teaming can be configured very similar to bonding. First we need to define a network interface type with the defauts. Eg:

```yaml
network_config::defaults
  ...
  team_interface:    
    bootproto: "none"
    defroute: "no"
    onboot: "yes"
```

Next we assign two interfaces that we want to be the be in the team. We also define a new interface that will be our `team0` and we can give it an interface type like we did earlier, eg:

```yaml
network_config::interface_names:
  ...
  eth3: team_interface
  eth4: team_interface
  team0: application
```

This will configure `team0` as an application interface inheriting all of our defaults from that type.  We also have `eth3` and `eth3` configured with general teaming defaults.

The final step is to define which real interfaces are members of which team interfaces, we do this with the `teams` parameter.

```yaml
network_config::teams:
  team0:
    interfaces:
      eth3: {}
      eth4: {}
```

The above will make sure that `eth3` and `eth4` interfaces are configured as members of `team0` with

```
NAME=eth3
TEAM_MASTER=team0
DEVICETYPE=TeamPort
```

... aswell as all the inherited configuration from the `team_interface` type.

The `teams` hash can also contain other team specific configuration to apply to the team interface (`team0` in our example). Eg:

```yaml
network_config::teams:
  team0:
    team_config:
      runner:
        name: lacp
        active: true
        fast_rate: true
      link_watch:
        name: ethtool
    interfaces:
      eth3: {}
      eth4: {}
```

Shared configuration common to all team interfaces maybe defined in the `team_defaults` hash

```yaml
network_config::team_defaults
  team_config:
    runner:
      name: lacp
      active: true
      fast_rate: true
    link_watch:
      name: ethtool

network_config::teams:
  team0:
    interfaces:
      eth3: {}
      eth4: {}
```

both configure in `team0`

```
TEAM_CONFIG='{"runner":{"name":"lacp","active":true,"fast_rate":true},"link_watch":{"name":"ethtool"}}'
```

Teaming also allows interface specific settings defined in the `team_port_config` Hash. Eg:

```yaml
network_config::teams:
  team0:
    interfaces:
      eth3:
        team_port_config:
          prio: 100
      eth4: {}
```

This will configure for `eth3` only

```
TEAM_PORT_CONFIG='{"prio":100}'
```

You can also specify `team_port_config` in the interface types if you use the same options over multiple
interfaces.

Instead of specifiying the content of `team_config` or `team_port_config` as Hash they can also be defined
directly as a String containing json. In this case the String value will be used as-is and be written to
the file surounded with single quotes.
